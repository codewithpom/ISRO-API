# This is an API for ISRO
This is a repo for the ISRO api built in express.

# Story
I actually built this because I wanted to report a bug is the ISRO official API [here](https://github.com/isro/api/). The bug was that it did not support requests from the frontend JavaScript because of CORS error, and thus I tried to solve it.

# How to contribute
Open an issue or make a pull request and even have some fun

# Where is it hosted
I have hosted it on a free hosting service named [replit](https://replit.com) on this link [working](https://replit.com/@PadmashreeJha/ISRO-API#index.js). I could even keep it private, but I have kept it public because I am contributing to the open-source.
