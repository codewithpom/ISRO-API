# This is an API for ISRO
This is a repo for the ISRO api built in express.

# Story
I actually built this because I wanted to report a bug is the ISRO official API [here](https://github.com/isro/api/). The bug was that it did not support requests from the frontend JavaScript because of CORS error, and thus I tried to solve it.
